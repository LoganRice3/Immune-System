## Attack to Base | Diseases and Disorders

Our bodies are constantly being attacked by all types of things that could harm us. Most of the time our bodies can defend against it, but sometimes our bodies lose or we’re born with a defect that hurts our body’s response to certain things. One thing that can happen is your immune system can turn against you and start to attack you that can cause serious problems like Diabetes where immune system antibodies attack insulin creating cells, Bowel disease where the lining of the intestine gets attacked, celiac disease is when your body cant take in glutten, and much much more. You can also be born with scid which is when your body is missing imprortant white blood cells that keep you safe from diseases. Sometimes the virus you have directly attacks the immune sysetm which then weakens it making the viruses symptons even worse than they were before.
